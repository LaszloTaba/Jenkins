# I followed the commands below to build a Jenkins server on a server in my home lab. 

# Start by updating the CentOS 8 repositories, which require running the following two commands to update the mirror repositories. 
# Please note that the commands might not work in the coming months as CentOS 8 is going through changes. 
sudo sed -i -e "s|mirrorlist=|#mirrorlist=|g" /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-*
sudo sed -i -e "s|#baseurl=http://mirror.centos.org|baseurl=http://vault.centos.org|g" /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-*

# Make sure the server, which I usually set to a multiuser.target by default for my home builds, is set to a graphical runlevel. 
# Jenkins uses a graphical interface, so the server needs to have that graphical mode. 
dnf set-default graphical
dnf isolate graphical

# Run the commands below to install Java and complete the Jenkins install.
dnf install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel
wget -P /etc/yum.repos.d/ â€“O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
dnf install java-11-openjdk-devel
wget -P /tmp/ https://get.jenkins.io/war-stable/2.319.2/jenkins.war
