# Below is a list of commands I followed to build a Jenkins server in CentOS 8. The official documentation starts with a Docker install, 
# https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/docker/, but I wanted to figure out the commands for a manual install to post on GitHub.

# The first step with CentOS 8 is to make sure the repositories are updated correctly. I've had to approach this in different ways, 
# and the way that works right now, as of my last updated of this file is to modify the files in /etc/yum.repos.d/.
# CentOS 8 is still relatively new and is changing, so the commands below might not work in a few months after writing this.
sudo sed -i -e "s|mirrorlist=|#mirrorlist=|g" /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-*
sudo sed -i -e "s|#baseurl=http://mirror.centos.org|baseurl=http://vault.centos.org|g" /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-*

# Make sure the server, which I usually set to a multiuser.target by default for my home builds, is set to a graphical runlevel. 
dnf set-default graphical
dnf isolate graphical

# Run the commands below to install Java and complete the Jenkins install.
dnf install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel
wget -P /etc/yum.repos.d/ â€“O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
dnf install java-11-openjdk-devel
wget -P /tmp/ https://get.jenkins.io/war-stable/2.319.2/jenkins.war
java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=8080
