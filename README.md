# Jenkins

This repository is currently just a collection of commands that I used to build a Jenkins server on CentOS 8. Normally, I'd just follow the instructions here, https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/, but I had to customize the directions to work for CentOS 8. I'm beginning to have ideas for a blog series about Jenkins, so I'll post code/files from that here as I get started.

By the way, my directions are for a manual installation of Jenkins, not for a quick build with Docker. As a rule of thumb, I like to figure out manual installations before defaulting to Docker, just so I understand what I'm installing better.
