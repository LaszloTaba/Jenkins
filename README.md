# Jenkins

This repository is currently just a collection of commands that I used to build a Jenkins server on CentOS 8. Normally, I'd just follow the instructions here, https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/, but I had to customize the directions to work for CentOS 8. I'm beginning to have ideas for a blog series about Jenkins, so I'll post code/files from that here as I get started.
