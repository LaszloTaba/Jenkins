# Jenkins

This repository is currently just a collection of commands that I used to build a Jenkins server on CentOS 8. I'd normally just default to what I find in the Jenkins offical documentation, but that didn't work correctly. In the future, I'll annotate this page further so that I can start a Jenkins project I have in mind, which I'll document here.
